It was a dark and stormy night, if you'd believe it, as I brought my blog post to unnatural life! Forgive the melodrama, but it's spooky season. What am I supposed to do, not make a combo Bulwer-Lytton/Shelley reference? I'm rather too tired to feel like a modern Prometheus... I certainly hope my website doesn't request a bride. Anyhow, I love Halloween-there's no holiday campier.
