# local_ceteicean
This repository is my first experiment with writing my own website (well, sort of) as part of my Introduction to Digital Humanities class. THis is the most "under the hood" I've gone when building a website. I have personalized it and added a few silly entries, just to test out how it works.

It contains a fork of Barry Clark's Jekyll Now repository (https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), plus a localized version of the TEI CETEIcean tool (https://github.com/TEIC/CETEIcean) for publishing XML in a browser. The localized version is modified so that it can work with students' own XML rather than with TEI.
